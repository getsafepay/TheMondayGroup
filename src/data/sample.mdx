Recent leadership changes at two iconic American companies provide an interesting opportunity to assess the impact of new CEOs on their respective businesses. On July 31, 2024, Kelly Ortberg was announced as the new CEO of Boeing, with his role becoming effective on August 8. Similarly, Brian Niccol is set to take over as CEO of Starbucks on September 9, 2024. Both leaders are stepping into their positions with high expectations and significant public attention, given that these are two of the most recognized brands worldwide. (On a recent trip, I found myself enjoying a Starbucks Dark Roast before boarding a Boeing 737.)

Despite their widespread popularity, both companies' stocks have significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the last five years, making them less attractive investments.

Ladies and gentlemen, grab your watermelon and mustard and get ready for the latest episode of "Who’s to Blame?" As the stock market dives faster than a skydiver without a parachute, we're pointing fingers at everyone's favorite culprit: the Federal Reserve! Did they snooze through the alarm, or are we just in need of a new scapegoat?

First let us see just how far back we need to go to see how far and fast we have fallen.

Concerning interest rates, it really is a walk into history. The last time the 2 year was at 3.88%, September 2022; the 10 year at 3.79%, July of last year. Stocks on the other hand need but a nostalgic trip to back to Memorial Day, as seen by the data below.

The Treasury market has definitely changed  since the last Fed meeting as shown below.

Back on June 15 the Fed Funds forecast for yearend 2024 was a mere ~25bps lower. Although the Fed hasn’t published a new dot plat the market has ratcheted up its forecast for a much more aggressive Fed. Back then the market estimated 4.81% by yearend 2024 and 3.90% by yearend 2025. No more so sanguine, As of yesterday the lasts market forecast has Fed Funds at 4.12 by the end of this year and 2.96% by the end of next year. Is the Fed engineering a soft landing or did they blow it and wait too long? Next up Jackson Hole and perhaps a dovish Jay P?

# Perspective
As many of you know I have been a big fan of Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman, 2 of the very best behavioral economists to ever put pen to paper. Back in 2001 after the Dot Com (Not Dot Plot) bubble burst he wrote the following:

<Putblockquote>If owning stocks is a long-term project for you, following their changes constantly is a very, very bad idea. Its the worst possible thing you can do, because people are so sensitive to short-term losses. If you count your money every day, you’ll be miserable.</Putblockquote>

So true right? How many of you were miserable this week? Only all of you that I spoke with. Take a break – eat watermelon today.

And speaking of Daniel Kahneman, let’s celebrate him today with a thought riddle. The kind of problems he liked to offer to unsuspecting students to determine how they might solve a problem.

This one is known as the Bridge and Torch Problem. 

Four people need to cross a narrow bridge at night. They have only one torch, and the bridge is too dangerous to cross without it. The bridge can only hold two people at a time. Each person walks at a different speed:
<br />
<li>Person A can cross the bridge in 1 minute.</li>
<li>Person B can cross the bridge in 2 minutes.</li>
<li>Person C can cross the bridge in 5 minutes.</li>
<li>Person D can cross the bridge in 10 minutes.</li>

When two people cross together, they must go at the slower person's pace. The goal is to get all four people across the bridge in the shortest time possible. How can they do this, and what is the minimum time required?

## California Is NOT Calling You – Another Chapter

Sun, sand, mountains, waves, wine, Hollywood, the San Diego Zoo and yes, well, the Dodgers. But I can not suggest you should follow. After a 145 years Chevron (it was known as Pacific Coast Oil Co then) is leaving the coast and heading to Texas. Why?  We know why, taxes, regulations and other social curiosities. They are not alone. See below for recent exits from the Golden State (who gets to keep the gold?).

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott celebrated the move on X, calling Texas Chevron’s “true home.” “Drill baby drill,” he wrote.

The 3 Body Problem or the 4 Ball Story

I must admit I enjoyed the series The 3 Body Problem on Netflix. The genre is sci-fi. The heros are flawed and the aliens remain unseen and seem evil. The 3 bodies are the planets, stars and suns. No spoiler alert here. 

But more importantly is the 4 Ball problem and yes, it’s a baseball story!!!

## I’ll summarize:

Whitey Ford is pitching. Yogi Berra is catching, and Casey Stengle is the Yankee manager. It’s the bottom of the first against the Chicago White Sox in Yankee stadium and Whitey is ready to throw pitch number 1 of the day to Luis Aparicio.
