I know it’s the start of football season, and some of you may have already moved on to America’s favorite sport but we are going back to our past and remember a magical moment in baseball that took place 59 years ago come September 9th. Any guesses before you continue?

Jeff M I am sure you aced this one. Yes, 59 years ago Sandy Koufax threw his 5th and final no-hitter, and what a beauty it was. 27 men up, 27 men down, a Perfect Game!! Koufax was in the 4th year of what most would call the greatest 5 year run a pitcher ever had. He won 111 games. 3 times his ERA was below 2.00. He whiffed 1444 baters in 1376 innings and completed 100 of his starts. (in the last 3 years ALL major league pitchers completed 114 games).

I could go on about Sandy for hours but there is no need to hear from me. Jane Leavy wrote a great book about Sandy aptly named Sandy Koufax – A Lefty’s Legacy. The book tells his life story from Brooklyn to LA and in every other chapter she takes us through a single inning of that perfect game.  I highly recommend this book. Want to re-live the moment? YouTube will give you the final inning as called by the one and only Vin Scully.

But there are a couple other items to remember about this game. First, of course, a trivia question. Only 1 player in major league history has been the last out of 2 no-hitters thrown by the same pitcher. In this case Koufax of course. Who was it? You require a clue? He was an AL Rookie of the Year, won a batting title in 1959 hitting .353, made 10 All-Star teams, had 2000 hits and managed the Milwaukee Brewers in 3 seasons. Oh yes, and married a former Miss Wisconsin.

There was also a record set that day back in 1959. The opposing pitcher was a little known hurler by the name of Bob Hendley. Hendley pitched the best game of his life and allowed but 2 baserunners, one by walk and one by a hit. The combined 2 baserunners is still a record for fewest baserunners allowed in a 9 inning game. Can you imagine throwing the game of your life in Dodger Stadium only to be a footnote in the Sandy Koufax story.   Bob, today we remember you as well!

## Thoughts Regarding the August 5th Market Meltdown
When the VIX spiked to 65 on the morning of August 5th, I decided it was time to dive back into the stock market. Not with reckless abandon, mind you—just enough to add a little spice to the single names already in my portfolio. It’s not often that I feel compelled to act, but high volatility is like a flashing neon sign that says, “Buy now, thank me later.”

This got me thinking about the few edges we individual investors still have in this era of algorithmic overlords and high-frequency trading wizards. It’s a bit like being David in a world full of Goliaths, but with the right slingshot, we can still take down the big guys. Here are a few advantages that might just give us the upper hand:

1. Early and Better Information: Back in the day, if you wanted the latest stock tips, you’d have to hang around the Dean Witter office, eavesdropping on the tickertape before the rest of the world caught on. Fast forward to the '80s, and insider info was as hot as Bud Fox’s hair gel. Today, though, we live in the age of the information superhighway—except it’s more like rush hour traffic, with everyone jostling for position. Unless a government agency has a Freudian slip and accidentally tweets out the jobs report early, the edge in information is about as sharp as a butter knife.

<Image src="/images/perfect-game/img2.png" width="400" height="200" />

2. Superior Analytical Tools: Remember when Excel was the pinnacle of financial modeling? Now, everyone and their grandmother has access to AI-powered tools that can crunch numbers faster than you can say “risk-adjusted returns.” The quants at Citadel are probably running models that look like they were designed by a NASA engineer on steroids. But even with all that firepower, predicting stock prices is still like trying to forecast next year’s fashion trends—sometimes, you’re spot on, and sometimes you’re rocking bell bottoms in a skinny jeans world.

3. Behavioral Advantages: Now, here’s where we might actually have a leg up. Unlike the quants, I don’t have to justify my trades to anyone except the person staring back at me in the mirror—thanks for the reminder, Michael Jackson. I can afford to ignore the quarterly noise, the market’s tantrums, and the latest doom-and-gloom headlines. Patience and conviction are my secret weapons, and I can play the long game while Wall Street’s whiz kids are playing musical chairs. Sure, I can’t turn around a sinking ship like an airline stock, but I can wait out a storm in sectors that everyone else has written off—homebuilders in 2022, anyone? Plus, when the meme stock mania fades, I’m still standing, ready to reap the benefits of long-term capital gains and tax losses.

4. Size Doesn’t Matter: Speaking of advantages, let’s talk size. When Berkshire Hathaway drops $260 million on Ulta Beauty, it’s just a drop in the ocean—0.03% of their portfolio, to be exact. For institutional investors, it’s getting harder to move the needle with small caps, and that’s where we can swoop in. Smaller companies with market caps under $2 billion? They’re like hidden gems that big institutions can’t touch without sending prices through the roof. We, on the other hand, can afford to be patient, hold these little dynamos, and watch them grow into giants—or at least respectable mid-caps.

So, there you have it—my musings on what still gives us a fighting chance in the market. I’d like to hear your thoughts. After all, this is just my take, not gospel truth. Let’s get the discussion rolling!

## TMG News

1. Next meeting will be Monday, September 16 at 5:30 PM. No scheduled topic yet. Look for an invite.
2. An abbreviated Deal Tracker will be out this weekend.
3. Since Jeff, Alex and I have joined the Core Club (TMG office locale) I am going to let TMG know when I am in NYC in case anyone wants to meet and talk or meet prospective deal/business opportunities. For the next few weeks I’ll be in 9/11, 9/19, 9/30 and 10/9.
4. Boeing v Starbucks. I received quite a few responses from TMG stock pickers to some of our ex-CEO’s. Most agree that Brian Nichol has the easier, first half of the journey. Over 80% of respondents predict that Starbucks will out-perform Boeing for the next 2 years. However most believe that when we push the timeline out 3 to 5 years that Kelly Ortberg and Boeing will outperform – mainly because – it has to. All agree that these are 2 big jobs and very CEO focused. We will be monitoring. Thanks for participating.
5. TMG welcomes Mary Haggerty to our prestigious membership. Mary worked at Bear (stop saying to yourself ‘another one?’). She ran a good part of our mortgage origination business there and then spent some years at JP Morgan doing the same. She is a Florida resident and is a Board member of Great Ajax, the REIT whose board I just rejoined. Mary is also on the board of Claros Mortgage Trust, a commercial mortgage REIT. More real estate expertise. You can never have too much. Welcome Mary!!

## NFL Valuations

The NFL is back. And so are updated team valuations. CNBC released new numbers this past week. The Top 1o are here and the full list is attached to this email. The Cowboys lead the list at $11B.  Jerry Jones can’t win big games, but he can make you really love or hate his team.

## Private Equity Coffers Are Full

<Image src="/images/perfect-game/img4.jpg" width="600" height="200" />

## Recap of the New NFL Rules Applying to PE
First — a quick recap. The private equity approved players are Arctos Partners, Ares Management, Sixth Street Partners and a consortium group that includes Dynasty Equity, Carlyle, CVC Capital Partners and Blackstone. Hall of fame running back Curtis Martin brought the groups together and led their collaboration.

A quick summary of the numbers :

<li>10% - the maximum investment by one fund in a club </li>
<li>7.5% - the cap a single investor can have within the ownership of one fund</li>
<li>3% - the minimum investment by one fund in a club</li>
<li>6 years - the minimum hold period for a PE Fund</li>
<li>6 - the maximum number of clubs a single fund can invest in</li>

Multiple executives across the league expect a surplus of deals to happen within the first 18 months. One source described the next couple months as the legal tampering period for NFL clubs and PE firms. In the NBA, that's when teams can reach out to free agents to sign them. In the NFL's case, clubs can reach out to the four PE parties and figure out deals.

## Who Is Paying the Tax Bill

It is election time, and we will hear plenty about who is paying their ‘fair share’ of taxes. Higher income taxes? a wealth tax? and 2 parties that have no idea or the energy to spend last. Table below shows who is footing the bill when paying individual income taxes. For example, the Top 1% (1.5M households) income earners pay 40% of all personal income taxes. The top 10% pay 71% of all income taxes. Cohort and cumulative numbers are shown.

## A Brief History of the World as Seen Through the Calendar

Whose land is it? Who came first? Who was removed or fled? Who came back? Who was peaceful and who was not? This comes up frequently when we consider Israel these days and who has claim over the ancient land. The comparison of the Hebrew calendar to the Gregorian calendar is below. I think it’s quite informative.

## What Does the US Look Like Today
Did you happen to notice that during the Olympics no country looked as diverse on the field or in the pool as the US. We criticize each other all the time for failing to do this or that and we love to point out all our shortcomings. Yet we remain the country that most would escape into and not from. Remember the Berlin Wall was not built to keep West Germans from trying to break into East Berlin.

The table below shows what we look like. Let’s remember to celebrate this.

## Koufax Answer
The answer you’ve been looking for is Harvey Kuenn who unfortunately ended 2 of Koufax’s 5 no-nos.

If this is of interest I included the box score of the game. The Dodgers won 1-0.
