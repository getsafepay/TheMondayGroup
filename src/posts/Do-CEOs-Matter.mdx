Recent leadership changes at two iconic American companies provide an interesting opportunity to assess the impact of new CEOs on their respective businesses. On July 31, 2024, Kelly Ortberg was announced as the new CEO of Boeing, with his role becoming effective on August 8. Similarly, Brian Niccol is set to take over as CEO of Starbucks on September 9, 2024. Both leaders are stepping into their positions with high expectations and significant public attention, given that these are two of the most recognized brands worldwide. (On a recent trip, I found myself enjoying a Starbucks Dark Roast before boarding a Boeing 737.)

Despite their widespread popularity, both companies' stocks have significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the last five years, making them less attractive investments.

However, both Ortberg and Niccol bring a track record of success to their new roles. Ortberg, an engineer by training, led Rockwell Collins before it was acquired by United Technologies in 2018, which later became part of RTX Corp. During his tenure from August 2013 to November 2018, Rockwell Collins’ stock more than doubled, yielding an annualized return of 15%. The aerospace industry views him as a top choice for Boeing.

Niccol, on the other hand, previously served as CEO of Taco Bell before being recruited to lead Chipotle from 2018 to 2024. Under his leadership, Chipotle’s stock soared by 750%, equating to an annualized return of 39%.

Let’s compare their compensation packages:

## Brian Niccol (Starbucks)

<li>Annual Base Salary: $1.6 million</li>
<li>Signing Bonus: $10 million</li>
<li>Annual Cash Incentive: Target of 225% of base salary (up to 450%), potentially $3.6 million to $7.2 million</li>
<li>Equity Awards: $75 million in initial equity grants</li>
<li>Annual Equity Awards: Up to $23 million starting in fiscal 2025</li>
<li>Total First-Year Potential: Over $100 million (potentially up to $116.8 million)</li>

## Kelly Ortberg (Boeing)

<li>Annual Base Salary: $1.5 million</li>
<li>Annual Incentive Award: Targeted at $3 million</li>
<li>Long-Term Incentive Award: Targeted at $17.5 million</li>
<li>One-Time Cash Payment: $1.25 million (payable in December)</li>
<li>Restricted Stock and Performance Awards: $16 million (vesting over four years)</li>
<li>Total First-Year Potential: Approximately $39.25 million</li>

## Key Differences:

1. Base Salary: Niccol's is slightly higher at $1.6 million vs. Ortberg's $1.5 million.
2. Signing Bonus: Niccol receives a substantial $10 million signing bonus, while Ortberg gets a smaller one-time cash payment of $1.25 million.
3. Equity Grants: Niccol's initial equity grant ($75 million) is significantly larger than Ortberg's restricted stock and performance awards ($16 million).
4. Annual Incentives: Niccol's potential cash bonus (up to $7.2 million) is higher than Ortberg's targeted $3 million.
5. Long-Term Incentives: Ortberg's package includes a specific long-term incentive award ($17.5 million), while Niccol's future annual equity awards could reach $23 million.
6. Total First-Year Potential: Niccol's package has a much higher potential value in the first year (over $100 million) compared to Ortberg's (about $39.25 million).
7. Location Flexibility: Niccol's package includes provisions for remote work from California, while no such arrangement is mentioned for Ortberg.

The last point is particularly interesting. Niccol will continue living in Southern California and has access to a private plane for travel to Starbucks’ headquarters as needed. Ortberg, on the other hand, is relocating to Seattle to be "on the factory floor" as Boeing addresses its many quality control issues. This raises some thought-provoking questions: Does Niccol come across as a prima donna? Is Ortberg the kind of inspirational leader we’d all like to work for? (Can you think of other prominent leaders who have been known to sleep on the factory floor?)

While both companies face significant but very different challenges, the question here is which stock will perform better over the next 12 months, 36 months, and 5 years. I’d love to hear your thoughts, and I will share the poll results.

Enjoy your Labor Day!
